# Festify

This was a project developed for BCS Hacks 2022, written in JavaScript with the React framework, and utilizes the Spotify API.

Our vision for the project was to leverage OCR technology to read festival lineup posters for artist names. The application would then parse the artist names, and using the Spotify API, get each artist's top 3 tracks, and create a playlist of these tracks. 

With this playlist, when you go to a music festival where you don't recognize some of the artists, at least now you will know what some of their top songs sound like so that it can ensure you can have a good time at their sets!
